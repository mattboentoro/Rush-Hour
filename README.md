# Rush-Hour
The puzzle called "Rush Hour" (c. ThinkFun, Inc., www.thinkfun.com) begins with a six-by-six grid of squares.  Little plastic cars and trucks are distributed across the grid in such a way as to preventone special car from moving off the grid, thereby escaping the traffic jam.  The initial configuration of cars and trucks is preordained by a set of cards, each containing a different starting pattern.  A player draws a card from the deck of cards, sets up the cars and trucks according to the pattern,and then tries to move the special car off the grid by sliding the cars and trucks up and down or left and right, depending on the starting orientation of the cars and trucks.The grid looks something like this:
